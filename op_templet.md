This is CandyKat. Built straight from SlimRom source with commits from a variety of different Sources/ROMS. 
We wanted to give the users a fun, fully customizable ROM.We aim to add more features as this project progresses. 
We have also come up with the Candy Sweetener Pack. This is an Aroma installer that is full of delicious treats. 
Inspired by the CandyShop thread on XDA it has everything from glow dots to statusbar mods[/CENTER].
